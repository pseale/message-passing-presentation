Message Passing presentation for the C# user group/NHDNUG
============================

Sample code and slides and notes from my presentation on Message Passing. The slides are zen-presentation style, but ugly, so it's hard to tell just from looking at them. By combining the slides (which are ugly and context-free) and the notes I wrote to myself (which I didn't use), you should get an idea of where I intended to go with the presentation.

The code samples speak for themselves, except the project called "TicTacToeMessages", which should instead be titled "TicTacToeWithExactlyOneMessageCommaImplementedPoorly".
