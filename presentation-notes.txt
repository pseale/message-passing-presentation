-Welcome
-I'm Peter Seale - @pseale
   - Understanding this is a deep topic, I have spent the last month growing 
      my neckbeard, take my 1 month of 
      neckbeard growth as a metaphor for my authority on the topic. No majestic
      flowing Gandalf beard, just 1 month's worth of authority 

-Goal: SUCCESS IN LIFE
  - success in life 
      <- better programming 
          <- more tools in your toolbox 
             <- tool: message passing
  - therefore, learning message passing will make you a SUCCESS

-Context: learning how to program OOP style
  - at the top of the diagram are the easy, objectively measured parts:
    - C# syntax
    - cohesion/coupling
    - Gang of Four/Head First Design patterns
  - towards the bottom, more subjective/contextual, no absolute universal "better" truth
    - SOLID - objective measures, subjectively improved code
    - DDD's domain model/ports and adapters/hexagon/onion architecture
    - CQRS
    - TDD
    - BDD
    - message passing

-Re-emphasize: message passing is USEFUL but not UNIVERSALLY USEFUL. it's a TOOL

- Alan Kay quote? - put it on screen while I ask the question

- With that in mind, I need to gauge the audience. Who can name some places you SEE message passing in action?
  You don't have to know everything about message passing, just say names of things with "message" in them.
  Looking for answers:
  - Biztalk /NServiceBus / MassTransit (.NET message bus)
  - MSMQ or RabbitMQ - durable messages
  - Azure uses durable messages
  - JavaScript frameworks that listen for server events
  - Event Aggregator as seen in WPF
  - Almost anywhere you have events

- Second question: what languages are known for message passing features?
  - Erlang
  - Scala
  - Go
  - Smalltalk
  - probably others

- Great, you have passed the job interview, you're all hired.

- What is message passing?
   - definition

- More interesting question: what makes message passing different from calling procedures?
  - Don't answer, we'll do this by example

- example: Tic Tac Toe (show procedural code)
  - This is GOOD CODE, it works and is "true to itself".
  - Explain what it does
- now show message passing code on right side
  - This is ALSO GOOD CODE.
  - Difference: less chatty, information hiding/encapsulation of behavior

- Now get "players" for the tic tac toe game
 - one player
- example 2: your classic WCF service call.
  - Procedural
    - Makes a call to the web service.
    - Data is returned.
    - Use the data.
  - Positives:
    - Simple, all fits on one page, top to bottom.
    - No threads
  - Negatives:
    - What happens during a timeout? Connection closed? What happens if it's slow?
  - Message passing
    - Sends message. Terminates.
    - Receives message.
    - Use the data.
    -Positives:
     -Simpler for the caller
    -Negatives:
     -In .NET it takes INFRASTRUCTURE to make this work
     -Threads/no longer a simple Von Neumann mental model
